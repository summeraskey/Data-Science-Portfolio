## Background
Hey! I'm Summer Askey, an applied statistics and analytics student at Brigham Young University with a strong passion for using data to uncover insights, solve problems, and drive meaningful impact. My academic background have given me hands-on experience with statistical inference, regression modeling, data visualization, and tools like R, Python, and Tableau.

Professionally, I bring proven leadership and client management skills. My experience in the client management and hospitality industry has strengthened my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly, build strong relationships, and create solutions tailored to diverse business needs.

I thrive at the intersection of data and people. My career interests include analysis, applied biostatistics, and data-driven strategy, and I’m always eager to learn, grow, and contribute in ways that make a measurable difference. I want to be part of a team that values creativity, excellence, and purpose. 

Beyond academic and professional skills, I am passionate about education, health, and family. I believe that human connection is our greatest offering to society.
